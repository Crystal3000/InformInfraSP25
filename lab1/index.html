        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
          The weather is always changing. It can be 2 degrees in spring and 90
          degrees in fall. It never makes sense and it's all despicable.

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>
          I have no idea what the population is, but it must be a lot of people
          for the prices of everything to be so high.

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>
          I don't care about sports, so I don't know much about it, but we have
