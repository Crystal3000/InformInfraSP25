## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project will be a review website of the children's basement area. I will be doing this review because that is the place that I probably spent the most time in while I was there. It also happened to be one of the most interactive place with stuff to do other than looking at stuff.

### Core Webpages

-Home Page: This will be the opening page that introduces the concept of the website and points the visitor to all the right places.
-About Page: The about page will explain what the website is for and will introduce me and what I do and why I'm reviewing basement exhibits.
-Official Review Page: This page will go into the official review of the children's basement area and will be the place where I give it a rating. Maybe I'll have a comment section where people visiting the site will share their thoughts and either agree or disagree with me. I might also have a star rating system where people can rate my opinion. Valid or not?

### Design Choices

List any websites that you might reference to influence your styling choices. List any colors used and what they were used for.

It will sort of be like these, but not. I don't want it to be really complex, I want it to be something that looks like an old man in his 50s made in the early 2000s to share his opinions on things that don't matter, just like what I'll be sharing my opinion on. So something really simple. I want to use maybe the color yellow to make it cheery and then everythign else will be basic webstyling. Maybe it will look like a backend developer trying out frontend styling for their portfolio website, so it won't look very good. That's the point.

I'm not sure what data structure I'm supposed to be describing, but I'll have a carousel of pictures at the top or sprinkled around in between text. I'll have the text very blocky and number all the different activities that are available.
