## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are places that store information; stuff like blogs, news sites, and other such things. Web applications are things where you can do stuff on them, I believe. Google docs, scriptwriting things, and Canva are some. These consist of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. As in the canvas page: HTML(HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure of the webpage, CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) controls the layout and design, and JS is responsible for making the page interactive and dynamic.

### VS Code & Extensions

Visual Studio Code is something where you can creat code and turn it into an actual website or something of the sort. It has extension where you can get extra stuff like VSC Pets and other such things. I've use it in the intro to web dev class. Coding is hard.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version Control is how you manage and look after the changes you make to code, Git is where you can have your code seen and worked on by others without their changes getting in the way really. Github is a platform that allows for you to share your code.

### Markdown & Documentation

A markdown is used for formatting, I think, and making things like text more interesting and converting it to HTML. Like headers and lists. # is used for making headers i.e. #heading1. Bold is made by two asterisks **on either side of what you want bolded** or two underscores **on what you want bolded**. Oooh it just did it. Italics are made by a single asterisk _on either side_ or a single underscore _on either side_. Unordered lists are made using asterisks, plus, or minus signs.

  While ordered lists are made by the regular schmegular number and period. I don't know how to un-indent this.

Okay, I figured it out.

Links are made using the brackets [put a name in this] and then parenthesis with the actual link (www.ketchup.com). That's not a real website, I don't think.

Images are made the same way but with an exclamation point in front of it because we're excited for cat pictures. ![another cat](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.4651676452.2100/bg,f8f8f8-flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.jpg)

I'm too lazy for the rest of the notes, but I'll be sure to reference them in the future.
